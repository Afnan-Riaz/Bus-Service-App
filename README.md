# Bus-Service-App
It was part of our second-semester programming project. We built this application using C++/CLI .NET framework, with MS SQL Server embedded for efficient data storage.
This app provides essential features such as:
* Seat booking based on routes and schedules
* Seat cancellation
* Secure payment and refund options
* A feedback mechanism for customers.

Additionally, we incorporated an admin panel to empower administrators to:
* Manage and edit crucial information about buses such as routes, schedules and features
* Manage user information
* Monitor customer feedback.

How to Use?
To run the project on your machine, you must add the given SQL files in the server explorer. I have provided the schema from which you can make a skeleton of the SQL tables.
Next, you have to insert some data into the tables. For example, to login to the application, you have to add atleast one entry in the passengers table to use it on login screen.
For embedding SQL into your project, you should use SSMS and Visual Studio 2022. First decode the script files in SSMS. Then connect to them from visual studio Server Explorer tab.
